# odin-recipes

Made a website that list the recipes for dishes.
Had to use 'img src' to display a picture of said dish along with 'ul' and 'ol' to list ingredients and steps. For descriptions, 'strong' and 'em' came in handy to make people want to use the recipes. Git was heavily used to keep tract of every step of the project.
